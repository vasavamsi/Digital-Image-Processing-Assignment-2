>> This is read me document for the Question No. 4 (Thresholding) in DIP Assignment-2

==> Code initiation:-

1> Run the test_script.
2> load any image (not with logical values) into the variable I.
3> Now input the second argument("lev") into the function "multithresh_19210112" can be provided as follows.
	> Don't give any input to obtain Single threshold using Otsu's method(by default).
	> Give input as 1 to obtain Single threshold using Global thresholding method.
	> Give input 2 or 3 for multiple thresholding using Otsu's method.
4> Now provide with the "values" array having lev+1 elements and within the range of 0 : 255.

==> Functions defined for this problem statement:-

1> multithresh_19210112( ) - to get the values of levels using Otsu's(by default) or Global thresholding method.
	input arguments - Input Image(I), no. of levels/method(in case of single thresholding)(N).
	output arguments - An array for the levels obtained after above calculations(y).

2> otsu( ) - to perform Otsu's algorithm.
	input arguments - An array of probabilities for all the intensities(p), An array of intensity values the algorithm have to be performed on(int).
	output arguments - Single threshold obtained after running algorithm.

3> imquantize_19210112( ) - to quantize the image using levels provided.
	input argument - Image(I), An array for levels(levels), An array for values(values).
	output argument - Quantized image(I_quant), An array of indices after quantization(index).

==> Comments:-

>> There is no extra input argument assigned for the input of "method", it is simplyt taken care by the second argument itself.
>> In single thresholding using Otsu's method, there will be an error of 2-3 pixels with respect to the actual value given by the inbuilt function for the same.
>> multiple thresholding is implemented the algorithm discussed in the class, but the output differs from the output generated by the inbuilt function, but in some
   test cases, the variation less.
